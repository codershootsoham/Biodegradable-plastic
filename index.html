			<p>Biodegradable plastic bags have gained popularity in recent years as a potential solution to the problem of plastic waste pollution. In India, the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags has been banned in several states, which has created a demand for biodegradable plastic bags. Here is some information on the biodegradable plastic bag business and practices in India</p>
            <p>1.Many companies in India have started producing biodegradable plastic bags to meet the demand. Some of the prominent players in this industry include Earthsoul India, BioGreen Bags, and BioPlast.</p>
            <p>2.Biodegradable plastic bags are made from materials that can decompose naturally, such as corn starch, cassava, and sugarcane. They are designed to break down into organic matter when exposed to certain conditions, such as sunlight and moisture.</p>
